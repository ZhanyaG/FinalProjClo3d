      <h2>Quick facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>944 million</strong> metric tons CO₂e — apparel industry emissions (recent industry estimate).</li>
        <li>About <strong>92 million tonnes</strong> of textile waste generated globally each year.</li>
        <li>Only around <strong>8–11%</strong> of textile fibres get recycled — most pieces end up in landfill or low-value uses.</li>
        <li>The virtual try-on / avatar fashion market is already in the low-billions (USD) and growing rapidly — immersive commerce adoption is accelerating.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <p>Digital outfits let people own many looks without buying, storing or washing extra garments. As AR/VR hardware and virtual wardrobe platforms mature, many will prefer to switch looks digitally and wear simpler, functional clothing in real life — reducing laundry, wear-and-tear and waste.</p>
